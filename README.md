## Purpose

Delivering cryogen generated static sites with the push of a few buttons.

c4k-website generates configuration files for an nginx webserver, and
a cryogen static site build container. It automatically downloads a branch.zip from a specified
gitea API url. You need an authorization token to access the specified gitea user account.
The build container is based on clojure:lein. Webserver and build pods are uniquely named by fqdn, so 
adding multiple websites shouldn't be a problem.

c4k-website has the following modules:
* unique nginx webserver + service + ingress + certificate
* unique build container cron job
* unique volume claim for both

## Try out

Click on the image to try out live in your browser:

[![Try it out](doc/tryItOut.png "Try out yourself")](https://domaindrivenarchitecture.org/pages/dda-provision/c4k-website/)

Your input will stay in your browser. No server interaction is required.

## Setup

You need:

* cryogen as a static site generator
* a cryogen project ready to build
* and a gitea account which holds the buildable project

Before deploying, you need an authorization token, that can be generated in your gitea account.
Then you need a URL that points to: `https://your.gitea.host/api/v1/repos/<owner>/<repo>/archive/main.zip`.
Add this to your auth.edn config file and you should be ready to go.

Let c4k-website generate your .yaml file and `kubectl apply yourApp.yaml`. Done.
